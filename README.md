# ecommerce
 An ecommerce project to practice using JS arrays and functions, as well as tinker around with CSS grids and flexbox.
 
The cart is fully functional (using local storage), which was my main aim -- products under "featured products" can be added to the cart, and you can get to the cart page by clicking ont he cart icon in the top right.
 
 The site is partially responsive, and I'd like to come back at some point to make it fully responsive. I also tried to implement an "Added to Cart" popup which would appear on the bottom left every time a product is added to the cart, but I haven't quite figured out how to make it fully functional. I've left the code in there commented out so I can come back to it later.
