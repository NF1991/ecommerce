# ecommerce
 An ecommerce project to practice using JS arrays and functions, as well as tinker around with CSS grids and flexbox.  The cart is fully functional (using local storage), which was my main aim -- products under "featured products" can be added to the cart, and you can get to the cart page by clicking ont he cart icon in the top right.
